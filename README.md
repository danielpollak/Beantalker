# Beantalker
little app that can communicate with LightBlue Beans. Pairing with Android allows the bean to become a smartwatch or (coming soon!) an infrared remote. Or both.


## Arduino
Upload to the LightBlue Bean the beandroid.ino sketch in hamdanspam/Beantalker/beandroid/.


## Android
The beantalker app is in the folder named, conveniently, hamdanspam/Beantalker/beantalker. You can load it in android studio and upload it to your phone from there, or use any other programmer available.

## How to use it
I knitted a little case for my bean and enclosed my bean on top of a cheap watch strap seen here:

### Hours
The led flashes in one color for however many hours it is

### Minutes
The led flashes in another color for however many minutes it is. I'm going to come up with a better plan eventually. Don't even sweat it.
